# Testicle
A testicle or testis is the male reproductive gland or gonad in all animals, including humans. It is homologous to the female ovary. The functions of the testes are to produce both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone.

# Anatomy
Most males are born with two testicles, collectively known as the testes. These soft, egg-shaped organs are located inside the scrotum. They are surrounded by a number of accessory structures including the epididymis and the vas deferens.

The testes are suspended from the abdomen by the spermatic cord. This is a collection of blood vessels, nerves, and ducts that support the health of the testes.1 A person whose testes remain inside their body is said to have undescended testes.

The testes consist of several lobes, each made up of seminiferous tubules. These tubules are the site in which sperm are produced. As sperm develop and mature they move through the tubules until they are collected in the rete testes and then passed through to the epididymis. The epididymis is where sperm mature before ejaculation.

The testes are enclosed in the tunica albuginea. This fibrous capsule surrounds the testes and also divides it into the lobules that contain the seminiferous tubules. The whole mass is then mostly surrounded by the tunica vaginalis. This covering allows the testes to move smoothly inside the scrotum. In adult males, the testes are 2-3 centimeters (cm) wide by 3-5 cm long.1 The testes increase in size through adulthood and then decrease in size later in life.

# Function
The testes have two primary functions. The first function of the testes is to produce testosterone. Testosterone is a steroid hormone that is responsible for sexual differentiation of the male. It is important for prenatal development. It also regulates the development of primary and secondary sexual characteristicsâ€”such as penis size and chest hair. In addition, testosterone contributes to the growth spurt that males experience during puberty, bone and muscle growth, and the formation of blood cells.

The second function of the testes is to produce sperm. Sperm develop inside the network of seminiferous tubules that make up a large portion of the testicles. Unlike females, who have a limited number of germ cells that can turn into eggs across the lifetime, men are able to make millions and millions of sperm every single day. It then takes several months for the sperm to mature enough to be functional upon ejaculation. This maturation starts in the testes but mostly takes place inside the epididymis.
